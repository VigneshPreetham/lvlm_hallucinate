# Thesis/ Capstone Project on LVLM Hallucinations
- I aim to reduce hallucinations with large vision language models
- An approach that I took is to use Recognize Anything Model tags for an image and feed into the prompt
- It increased the test accuracy of the internVL-4B model when tested on the POPE benchmark by 20%
